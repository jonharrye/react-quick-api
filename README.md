# `create-react-app` with a server example


This project demonstrates using the setup generated by `create-react-app` alongside a Node Express API server.

## Overview

`create-react-app` configures a Webpack development server to run on `localhost:3001`. This development server will bundle all static assets located under `client/src/`. All requests to `localhost:3000` will serve `client/index.html` which will include Webpack's `bundle.js`.
